Things to do for project

Main idea: eliminate the ExecutionTree data structure, and hold the tree structure entirely
  in the inductive relation node_eval
- Relate a program and a single node: for each type of statement, have a constructor that
  adds either one or two nodes to the relation
- Now we can do induction "bottom up"

Issue: will we ever need information from the whole tree? How to do property 2?

- General proofs
- Redo example trees

Notation wish list:
- Replace S (S O) in proofs with %nat
