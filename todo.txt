Things to do for project

- Add depth to node_eval
	* Add more base case constructors (ex. Partially executed ?)
- General proofs
- Potentially separate out into one file with all definitions and another with proofs

Notation wish list:
- Replace S (S O) in proofs with %nat
- Put state notation inside symbolic expression brackets

Later:
- Writing a program more cleanly
  * Redefine program to match Imp model
- Maybe move variable definitions around?

New strategy: 
* Relating prog, old tree, leaf idx and new tree
* want to rewrite node_eval with this new signature
* Just finished get leaves fn to get a list of the leaves
