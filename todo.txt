Things to do for project

- Fix matching boolean expressions
  * Separate BoolExp used in programs from BoolExp used in path conditions

- Add depth to node_eval
- See if the node_eval hypotheses can be simplified
- Add notation for trees
- Add notation for programs
- Fix satisfiability hypothesis so we don't generate unsatisfiable nodes
- Prove superset_SAT axiom
- General proofs 
- Potentially separate out into one file with all definitions and another with proofs
- define variables all together

Notation for:
- Writing a program more cleanly; perhaps rewrite so we can do symbolic expressions the same just without 's', inside diff bracket
- Nodes, PC
-
