Things to do for project

- Add depth to node_eval
- Prove superset_SAT axiom
- General proofs
- Potentially separate out into one file with all definitions and another with proofs

Notation wish list:
- Replace S (S O) in proofs with %nat
- Put state notation inside symbolic expression brackets
- See if the node_eval hypotheses can be simplified

Later:
- Writing a program more cleanly
  * Redefine program to match Imp model
- Maybe move variable definitions around?
