Things to do for project

- Add depth to node_eval
- See if the node_eval hypotheses can be simplified
- Fix satisfiability hypothesis so we don't generate unsatisfiable nodes
- Prove superset_SAT axiom
- General proofs
- Potentially separate out into one file with all definitions and another with proofs
- perhaps rewrite so we can do symbolic expressions the same just without 's', inside diff bracket


Later:
- Writing a program more cleanly
  * Redefine program to match Imp model
- Maybe move variable definitions around?
