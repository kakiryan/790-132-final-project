Things to do for project

- General proofs
- Potentially separate out into one file with all definitions and another with proofs
- Prove that when adding a node, the index in the tree of where we want to add doesn't get impacted

Notation wish list:
- Replace S (S O) in proofs with %nat

Later:
- Writing a program more cleanly
  * Redefine program to match Imp model
