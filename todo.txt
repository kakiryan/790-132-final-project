Things to do for project

Immediate future steps:
- Write node equality
- Write tree_diff function
- Switch between a tree and a list of all its nodes (need to have a definition of SAT_nodes)
- tree_diff tr (add_node tr x node) = [node] theorem

- Factor out into multiple files
- General proofs
- Potentially separate out into one file with all definitions and another with proofs
- Prove that when adding a node, the index in the tree of where we want to add doesn't get impacted

Notation wish list:
- Replace S (S O) in proofs with %nat

Later:
- Writing a program more cleanly
  * Redefine program to match Imp model
