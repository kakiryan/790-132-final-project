Things to do for project

- Fix matching boolean expressions
  * Separate BoolExp used in programs from BoolExp used in path conditions

- Factor out common hypotheses for eval relation (?)
- Add depth to node_eval
- See if the node_eval hypotheses can be simplified
- Add notation for trees
- Add notation for programs
- Fix satisfiability hypothesis so we don't generate unsatisfiable nodes
